    <h2>Bio</h2>

    <p>
      Kanye Omari West (born June 8, 1977) is an American rapper, singer, songwriter, record producer,
      businessman, and fashion designer. Born in Atlanta and raised in Chicago, West gained notoriety
      as a producer for Roc-A-Fella Records in the early 2000s, producing singles for several popular
      artists. Intent on pursuing a solo career as a rapper, West released his debut album, The College
      Dropout (2004), to critical and commercial success, and founded the record label GOOD Music. He
      went onto experiment with a variety of musical genres on subsequent acclaimed albums, including
      Late Registration (2005), Graduation (2007), and 808s & Heartbreak (2008). Drawing inspiration
      from maximalism and minimalism respectively, his fifth album My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy
      (2010) and sixth album Yeezus (2013) were also released to critical and commercial successes.
      West also diversified musical styles on The Life of Pablo (2016) and Ye (2018), and explored
      Christian music on Jesus Is King (2019). After a series of delays, West released his highly
      anticipated tenth album, Donda (2021). West's discography also includes the full-length
      collaborative albums Watch the Throne (2011) with Jay-Z and Kids See Ghosts (2018) with Kid Cudi.
      West's outspoken views and life outside of music have received significant media coverage. He has
      been a frequent source of controversy for his conduct at award shows, on social media, and in
      other public settings, as well as for his comments on the music and fashion industries, U.S.
      politics, and race. West is often lauded as one of hip hop's greatest artists, with his music
      being recognized as some of the best-selling and most critically acclaimed in hip hop history. In
      2020, he ran an independent presidential campaign that advocated for a consistent life ethic. His
      Christian faith, as well as his marriage to television personality Kim Kardashian, have also been
      sources of media attention. As a fashion designer, he has collaborated with Nike, Louis Vuitton,
      and A.P.C. on both clothing and footwear, and have most prominently resulted in the Yeezy
      collaboration with Adidas beginning in 2013. He is the founder and head of the creative content
      company DONDA. West is one of the world's best-selling music artists, with more than 160 million
      records sold worldwide. He has won a total of 22 Grammy Awards, making him one of the most awarded
      artists of all time. Among his other awards are the Billboard Artist Achievement Award, a 
      joint-record three' Brit Awards for Best International Male Solo Artist and the Michael Jackson
      Video Vanguard Award. Six of his albums were included on Rolling Stone's 2020 500 Greatest Albums
      of All Time list; the same publication named him one of the 100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time.
      West is the tied holder for the most albums (four) topping the annual Pazz & Jop critic poll, a
      distinction he shares with Bob Dylan. Time magazine named him one of the 100 most influential
      people in the world in 2005 and 2015. (Source: Wikipedia--https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanye_West)
